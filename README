This project is going to be a dashboard/service for getting prices of crypto 
currencies. 

My initial plan for this project was to just create an email service that 
would send me an email at the end of the day for the OHLCV which means
"Open High Low Close Volume." Then I thought about what would be missing from 
the report, and the daily average was the first thing that came to mind.

To solve the problem of getting the daily average, making a program to run as 
a daemon process to grab data from an API and store it in a database is the 
easiest solution that comes to mind. This database will have procedures to grab
the average value and one to also purge the data that passes the day expiration
period (since I only want the daily average).

So the daemon process will be programmed in C to make it lightweight. The email
program will be in python so that expandability will be much easier. If I want
to expand to a website with graphs in the future, it will be much easier to 
build it in python compared to C.
